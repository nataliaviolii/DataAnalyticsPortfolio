									<h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
									<p></p>
									<h3>Company</h3>
									<p>Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.</p>
									
									<h3>Current Situation</h3>
										<p>Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.</p>
									
									<h3>Task</h3>
									The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
										<li>Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?</li>
										<li>What was the average rental duration for all videos?</li>
										<li>Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?</li>
										<li>Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?</li>
										<li>Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</li></p>
									
									<h3>Objective</h3>
										<p>To help Rockbuster Stealth's Business Intelligence (BI) department with the launch strategy for the new online video service.</p>
									
									<h3>Context</h3>
									This project was created with the aim of diving deeper into the use of SQL tool as a part of <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IXdPVviXDliTmw4f7dmYXgf_hEH_oRSW/view?usp=sharing"  target="_blank" class="">CareerFoundry's Data Immersion Program</a>

									<h2>PROCESS</h2>
									<p></p>
										<h3>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</h3>
										An ERD illustrates the links between the tables in a relational database. My first step was to extract the snowflake ERD with the help of DBVisualizer tool. The snowflake schema is a multidimensional data model which is an extension of the star schema, in which the dimension tables are broken down into subdimensions. 
										From the snowflake ERD below, I separated the table into two parts:
											<li>Fact Tables</li>
											<li>Dimension Tables</li>

										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ERD.png" alt="" /></span>

									
										<h3>Join Table</h3>
										I used inner join quite often across this project where it helps me look up matching values in the join column to connect two tables. As an example below when I wanted to find out the top 20 countries with highest total payment with the help of their foreign or primary key:
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_join.png" alt="" /></span>	

										<br>
									
										<h3>Subquery</h3>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_subquery.png" alt="" /></span>
											<b>My notes:</b>
											<li>In this case, I can't do the step above without subqueries (or CTEs) as I am doing multiple levels of aggregations, where I sum first then proceed to count </li>
											<li>The sum here is calculated with the help of the aggregate function SUM() and is returned by the subquery. In other words, I can't replace the subqueries because I don’t have a table with the sum previously calculated </li>

										<br>
									
										<h3>Common Table Expressions (CTE)</h3>
											<b>My notes:</b>
											<li>Some of the main things that make CTEs advantageous over subqueries are maintainability and multiple referencing </li>
											<li>Later (in complex queries) I believe CTE will be more useful because once I already store the value in the CTE, then whenever I need it, I can simply refer to it by the CTE name </li>
											<li>If I want to do an update then it will be more efficient because I only need to update the CTE query (I only need to change it in one place) and call it back once it is fixed </li>
											<li>Since things get complicated later, CTE will be the best option for making queries readable</li>

										<br>
										<h3>Analysis</h3>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_analysis.png" alt="" /></span>
											<b>Correlation between average rental duration and average movie length grouped by category:</b>
												<li>The average rental duration based on the average movie length is about 5 days</li>
												<li>The correlation is 0.4, which is low</li>
											Therefore, the movie length doesn't really affect the results of the rental duration

											<br>
											<b>Correlation between average rental duration and average rental rate grouped by category:</b>
												<li>The average rental duration based on the average rental rate is about 5 days</li>
												<li>The correlation is 0.06, which is very low</li>
											Therefore, the rental rate doesn't not affect or provide any correlation to the results of the rental duration

									<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
									<blockquote>
									<div style=text-align:justify>
										<li>Knowing that price rate is not a major factor in renting movies to customers, then it would be nice to increase the average price rate to get more revenue out of it (especially for those top 5 categories). However, we must also consider other aspects before implementing this strategy</li>	
										<li>Knowing Netflix and Amazon Prime get most of their revenue from the United States, then continuing to expand markets in our strong region of Asia (India and China) would be profitable</li>
										<li>Apart from India and China, we can start to focus our market on other Asian countries especially Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam which have higher average payouts per customer compared to the top 5 countries</li>
										<li>Continue to focus on categories that generate more revenue such as Sports, Sci-Fi, Animation, Drama and Comedy</li>
										<li>Considering that the majority of customers are also from China, adding Chinese subtitles would be a good idea</li>
