								<p>	<b>Hi, I am Natalia (23 years old) from East Java, Indonesia.</b>
									<br>
									<br>
									My Data Analytics Journey begins in 2022. Even though before that I already knew some data analytics knowledge such as SQL and Data Visualization, I never delved deeper into this field because at that time I was focusing myself on the ICT & Business field. After finishing my bachelor in July 2022, I felt challenged and I decided to take some free introductory data analysis courses to convince myself if I wanted to continue my career path as a Business Analyst or Data Analyst. At that time I believed that working in a field that I love is not only beneficial for me but also for the company because I can give my best in it.
									<br>
									<br>
									Since I love mathematics and I am a detail oriented person, during the free course I felt quite confident that this field aligned with my passion. Since then, I decided to go one step further by enrolling myself in the Data Analytics Bootcamp provided by <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/" target="_blank" >CareerFoundry</a>. Through this course, I am truly equipped with many skills needed to become a Professional Data Analyst in the world of work. Never regretting the choices I made on this journey, now I am excited to see myself growing deeper as a Data Analyst.
									<br>
									<br>
									I have dedicated myself to studying data analytics with CareerFoundry since December 2022 and during that time I was able to create several <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a> that apply many important skills in data analytics. By this time, I feel very excited and I am ready to enter my professional working life as a Junior Data Analyst. Not wanting to take anything for granted, I will always be willing to learn and be trained by any company that gives me the opportunity to work with. I do respect every opportunity given and therefore I want to give it my best. Thank you! :) <br>
									<br>
									<b>Best regards,</b>
									<br>
									<b>Natalia</b>
