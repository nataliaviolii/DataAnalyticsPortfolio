									<h2>Hi there.</h2>
										<p>Hi, I’m Natalia from East Java, Indonesia. As a Data Analyst with a background in ICT and Business, I offer a unique blend of skills from my previous experience as a Business Analyst and my current role, Data Analyst. I bring experience in analytical skills such as identifying business requirement, analyzing business processes, and visualizing business flows. My analytical skills have been further refined through numerous data analysis projects completed during my data analytics bootcamp.</p>

									<b>Me and data analytics.</b>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst, I have technical skills in operating Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating and visualizing data to uncover patterns and analyze trends, providing valuable insights to address business questions.  My favorite part of being a data analyst is when I have to deal with data visualization. I get excited when I have to turn information into easier-to-understand dashboards. It's also fascinating to see how data has the power to unlock the future. From tracking my daily income and expenses for monthly comparisons to making forecasts, optimizing staffing needs, and analyzing purchasing behavior to deliver data-driven solutions.
									<br></p>

									<b>What makes me different?</b>
									<br>
									In addition to my passion for data visualization, I am also a detail oriented and math lover. My attention to detail helps me analyze data carefully, while my love for math makes challenging calculations and statistics enjoyable. As part of my personality, most of my friends say that I am a cheerful and positive person. I consider myself a fast learner where I try to do things with excellence and will put extra miles in it. I value humility and integrity. I learn to do right things not because someone is watching me but because of who I am. Here I am willing to learn something new, humbly accept feedback, and be corrected if I make a mistake. In my daily free time, I enjoy playing with my guitar and occasionally writing my own songs. Other hobbies are playing chess, cubes and drawing.
									<br></p>

										<p>Now I am ready and feel excited to continue my journey as a professional Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. Are you looking forward to collaborations in the field of data analytics? I welcome the opportunity to be part of the team. Together we can make an impact and let's create more data-driven solutions and build our magic dashboard together! ✨</p>
