								<p>	<b>Hi, I am Natalia (23 years old) from East Java, Indonesia.</b>
									<br>
									<br>
									I am a Data Analyst based in Amsterdam with ICT & Business background. After completing my bachelor in July 2022, I decided to hone my skills and pursue my passion in data analytics. At that time I felt challenged and decided to go further with my data analytics journey despite my previous experience as a business analyst. At that time I believed that working in a field that I love is not only beneficial for me but also for the company because I can give my best in it.
									<br>
									<br>
									Since I love math, I can still find myself enjoying doing some statistics while analyzing data even when I am stuck. My attention to detail helps me analyze data carefully and I can express my creativity when building dashboards. It did not stop there, I continued further by taking the Data Analytics Bootcamp provided by <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/">CareerFoundry.</a> Through this intensive course, I have been equipped with several important skills such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating and visualizing data to gain insight by uncovering patterns and analyzing trends to help answer business questions. Throughout my project-based Data Analytics Bootcamp, I successfully built several projects that provided critical insights to help guide data-driven decisions.
									<br>
									<br>
									I have dedicated myself to studying data analytics with CareerFoundry since December 2022 and during that time I was able to create several <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a> that apply many important skills in data analytics. I have technical skills in operating SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau. I am skilled in analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing data to gain insight by uncovering patterns to answer business questions. By this time, I feel very excited and I am ready to enter my professional working life as a Data Analyst.
									<br>
									<br>
									One of my main strengths is my attention to detail. I believe as a Data Analyst, this ability is important to handle big data. Calculating is also my passion, I can still enjoy doing math even when I feel stuck. I also get passionate when it comes to visualizing data. I find it both challenging and satisfying when I can interpret data into something that is easier to understand through data visualization.
									<br>
									<br>
									Regarding my personality, many of my friends say that I am a cheerful person because I believe that energy is contagious. Both of my tutors from Internship and Bootcamp recommended working with me on LinkedIn because they said I am a fast learner. Since humility is key for me,  I will always be willing to learn, I humbly accept feedback, and be corrected if I make a mistake. I do not want to take anything for granted, I do respect every opportunity given and therefore I want to give it my best. Thank you!
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Best regards,</b>
									<br>
									<b>Natalia</b>
