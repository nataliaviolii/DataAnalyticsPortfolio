									<h2>Hi there.</h2>
										<p>Hi, I am Natalia from East Java, Indonesia. As a Data Analyst with ICT & Business background, I offer a unique collaboration between my previous experience as a Business Analyst and my current role as a Data Analyst. I bring experience in analytical skills such as identifying business requirement, analyzing business processes, and visualizing business flows. My analytical skills developed further as I worked on several data analysis projects throughout my data analytics bootcamp.</p>

									<<b>Me and data analytics.</b>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst, I have technical skills in operating Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating and visualizing data to uncover patterns and analyze trends to help answer business questions.  My favorite part of being a data analyst is when I have to deal with data visualization. I get excited when I have to turn information into easier-to-understand dashboards. It's also interesting to see how data has the power to unlock the future. From the little things in my everyday life like tracking my daily income/expenses for monthly comparisons, to the big things where I can make forecasts, address staffing needs, and analyze purchasing behavior to help deliver data-driven solutions.

									<br>
									Hi, I am Natalia from East Java, Indonesia. As a Data Analyst with ICT & Business background, I offer a unique collaboration between my previous experience as a Business Analyst and my current role as a Data Analyst. I bring experience in analytical skills such as identifying business requirement, analyzing business processes, and visualizing business flows. My analytical skills developed further as I worked on several data analysis projects throughout my data analytics bootcamp.

									<b>Me and data analytics.</b>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst, I have technical skills in operating Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating and visualizing data to uncover patterns and analyze trends to help answer business questions.  My favorite part of being a data analyst is when I have to deal with data visualization. I get excited when I have to turn information into easier-to-understand dashboards. It's also interesting to see how data has the power to unlock the future. From the little things in my everyday life like tracking my daily income/expenses for monthly comparisons, to the big things where I can make forecasts, address staffing needs, and analyze purchasing behavior to help deliver data-driven solutions.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>What makes me different?</b>
									<br>
									In addition to my passion for data visualization, I am also a detail oriented and math lover. My attention to detail helps me analyze data carefully and my love for math helps me keep enjoying challenging calculations/statistics while analyzing data. As part of my personality, most of my friends say that I am a cheerful and positive person. I consider myself a fast learner where I try to do things with excellence and will put extra miles in it. I am also willing to learn something new, humbly accept feedback, and be corrected if I make a mistake. In my daily free time, I usually play my guitar and write my own songs. Other hobbies are playing chess, cubes and drawing.
