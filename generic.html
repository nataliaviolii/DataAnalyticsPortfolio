									<h2>Hi there.</h2>
										<p>Hi, I’m Natalia from East Java, Indonesia. As a Data Analyst with a background in ICT and Business, I offer a unique blend of skills from my previous experience as a Business Analyst and my current role, Data Analyst. I bring experience in analytical skills such as identifying business requirement, analyzing business processes, and visualizing business flows. My analytical skills have been further refined through numerous data analysis projects completed during my data analytics bootcamp.</p>

									<b>Me and data analytics.</b>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst, I have technical skills in operating Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating and visualizing data to uncover patterns and analyze trends, providing valuable insights to address business questions.  My favorite part of being a data analyst is when I have to deal with data visualization. I get excited when I have to turn information into easier-to-understand dashboards. It's fascinating to experince the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights. From the tiny data analytics skills such as tracking my daily income and expenses for monthly comparisons to ultimately making forecasts, optimizing staffing needs, and analyzing purchasing behavior to deliver data-driven solutions.
									<br></p>

									<b>What makes me different?</b>
									<br>
									In addition to my passion for data visualization, I am also a detail oriented and math lover. My attention to detail helps me analyze data carefully, while my love for math makes challenging calculations and statistics enjoyable. As part of my personality, most of my friends say that I am a cheerful and positive person. I consider myself a fast learner where I try to do things with excellence and will put extra miles in it. I value humility and integrity. I learn to do right things not because someone is watching me but because of who I am. Here I am willing to learn something new, humbly accept feedback, and be corrected if I make a mistake. In my daily free time, I enjoy playing with my guitar and occasionally writing my own songs. Other hobbies are playing chess, cubes and drawing.

										<p>Now, I am ready and excited to continue my journey as a professional Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. Are you looking forward to collaborations in the field of data analytics? I welcome the opportunity to be part of your team. Together, we can make an impact by creating more data-driven solutions and building our magic dashboard!</p>

									<p> Once my father said, <b>“Where there is a will, there is a way."</b> </p>

								<p><b>“Be the Leader You Wish You Had.” Simon Sinek</b></p>  
								<p>This quote has taught me a lot, and I believe it works both ways: Be the junior you wish you had when you're a senior. I always imagine myself as a successful person in the future, able to help people in need. To get there, the journey will, of course, start from zero. For example, besides focusing on my studies, I also have a side job as a waitress. I constantly ask myself: Would I love to have someone like me as a waitress if I were the restaurant owner? This question changes the way I work. Simply put, if I need to sweep the floor, I will do it to a good standard, regardless of whether my manager sees me or not.  It's not just about completing the task, but about how I do it. I reflect on how I would feel as the restaurant owner and know I would appreciate a waitress who cleans the floor properly and serves wholeheartedly. At the end I will say to myself: Be the waitress I wish I had if I were the restaurant owner. I believe we reap what we sow, and by being faithful with little things, we will eventually be entrusted with bigger responsibilities. <b>That’s the reason why character matters more than skills. Skills can be taught, but character is who they are.</b></p>
