								<p>	<b>Hi, I am Natalia (23 years old) from East Java, Indonesia.</b>
									<br>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst with ICT & Business background, I offer a unique collaboration between my previous experience as a Business Analyst and my current role as a Data Analyst. I bring experience in analytical skills such as identifying business requirement, analyzing business processes, and visualizing business flows. During my internship, I have successfully performed a GAP Analysis to bridge the gap between my company's service processes and SAP Field Service Management. My analytical skills developed further as I delved deeper into data analytics field as part of my passion.
									<br>
									<br>
									As a Data Analyst, I am skilled at analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing data to uncover patterns and analyze trends to help answer business questions. Throughout my journey, I highlight data visualization as my favorite part of being a data analyst since I can use my creativity to turn information into easier-to-understand dashboards. despite my challenging journey it was well worth taking. It is very interesting to see how data has the power to unlock the future once I know how to analyze patterns and trends. From the little things in my daily life like keeping track of my daily income/expenses using apps to give me insight into my financial condition, to the big things where I can make forecasts, address staffing needs, and analyze purchasing behavior.
									<br>
									<br>
									In addition to my passion for data visualization, I am also a detail oriented and math lover. My attention to detail helps me analyze data carefully and my love for math helps me keep enjoying challenging calculations/statistics while analyzing data. As part of my personality, most of my friends say that I am a cheerful and positive person. As a person who values good attitude and humility, I will always be willing to learn, humbly accept feedback, and be corrected if I make a mistake. In my daily free time, I usually play my guitar and write my own songs. Another hobby is playing chess and cubes.
									<br>
									<br>
									Now I am ready and very excited to continue my journey as a professional Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. Are you looking forward to collaborations in the field of data analytics? I welcome the opportunity to be part of the team. Together we can make an impact and let's create more data-driven solutions and build our magic dashboard! âœ¨
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Best regards,</b>
									<br>
									<b>Natalia</b>
